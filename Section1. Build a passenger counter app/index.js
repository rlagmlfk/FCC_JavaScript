// document.getElementById("count").innerHTML = 5
// JavaScript starts reading at the top and works its way downwards.

let count = 7;

//console.log(myAge); // your value before it has been initialized, and that simply doesn't work.

// 1. Create a variable, myAge, and set its value to your age

// let myAge = 28;

// 2. Log the myAge variable to the console
//console.log(myAge);
